LinkedIn Master, if you are serious about your linkedin connections and want to integrate your personal or company linkedin page into your wordpress.


== Description ==

No doubts about it, if you are serious about your linkedin connections and want to integrate your personal or company linkedin page into your wordpress website, then LinkedIn Master is the solution for your.

You can display your personal linked-in profile, your company linkedin profile or both at the same time maximizing and expanding your connections. Integrates flawless in any widget template position so it always looks good and you can display it anywhere inside your wordpress pages and posts.

In case you want to display both profiles, personal and company linked in profiles, we added the option of displaying them horizontally or vertically.

Again and as usual with TechGasp extensions, the code is pristine, error free and with fast page loading times. Professional or business pages need to be fast to google rank better and to avoid website visits drop outs. If you are looking for a way to just display just the LinkedIn share button, then we recommend you the Social Master extension.
